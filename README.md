Most lightweight, yet most configurable and advanced PrismJS WordPress integration plugin. Custom fields display (Detached) supported.

## Description ##

Despite two plugins already on wordpress.org I decided to write my own from scratch. The result is a very capable minimalistic plugin with only ~250 lines of PHP.

* Supports every possible Prism configuration.
* Does not load prism on every page, only when needed.
* Supports automatic detection of prism HTML.
* Supports displaying code from custom fields with `[prism]` shortcode.
* Developers may use the `prism` handle to enqueue the pre-registered script and style.
* Has admin editor button for quick shortcode template snippet.
* Has no options page by design.
